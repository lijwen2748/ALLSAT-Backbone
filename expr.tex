\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:expr}
minimal blocking experiments
in 1 hour and in 10 hours
different benchmarks
different solvers (bc, nbc, bdd, allsat, tool)

the length of partial assignments 

for formulas that does not have backbone variables, due to different covering strategy, the performance are different
