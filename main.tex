% \title{Solving All-SAT with Backbone Techniques}
\title{Accelerating All-SAT Computation with Short Blocking Clauses }
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The All-SAT (All-SATisfiable) problem focuses on finding all satisfiable assignments of a given propositional formula, whose applications include model checking, automata construction and the test-case generation. To solve this problem, traditional approaches require a large amount of SAT calls.
In this paper, we introduce \tool, a backbone-based All-SAT solver for propositional formulas. Compared to the extant work, \tool utilizes backbone information to obtain shorter partial assignments. As a shorter partial assignment potentially represents a set of more full assignments, the backbone information is able to accelerate the All-SAT computation. 
Experiments show that though finding backbone variables pays additional cost, \tool performs better than the extant tools including \ctool, \bc, \nbc and \bdd.
Given the same time and memory resources, \tool solves the largest amount of benchmarks by gaining 14, 15, 26, 28 more instances than \ctool, \bc, \nbc and \bdd respectively, out of the total 608 instances.
% (79), \ctool solves 65 formulas, \bc solves 64 formulas, \nbc solves 53 formulas and \bdd solves 51 formulas.
Also, \tool performs the fastest on the 30 formulas that can be solved by all 5 tools, saving the percentage of 51\%, 48\%, 54\% and 67\% time cost than \ctool, \bc, \nbc and \bdd respectively.
% (9558.64 seconds), which is 51\% less than \ctool(19427.51 seconds), 48\% less than \bc(18221,86 seconds),  54\% less than \nbc(21263.27 seconds) and 67\% less than \bdd(28901.35 seconds).
